  <title>Map A (13004 version)</title>
    <!-- This map establishes the scope "map-a".
      
         The use case is that you want to be able to reference 
         topics using keys of the form "map-a.foo" from outside
         this scope, but "foo" from within the scope, that is,
         topics that are only ever used from within this scope
         or for which "foo" will be defined in whatever scope
         the topic is used.
         
         We now include the map-a local keydefs within this
         scope so that these keydefs are within the scope
         and thus unqualified references to them will work.
         
         Note that we can't put the scope on the map with 
         the keydefs because that map doesn't then contain
         the navigation topicrefs that we want to be in the
         scope.
         
         This means that each use of topic-a's.
