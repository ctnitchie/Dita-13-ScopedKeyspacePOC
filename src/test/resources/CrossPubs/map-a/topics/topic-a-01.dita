    <p>This topic is "owned" by map A. The references to keys in the map A are
      unqualified. The references to keys in map B are qualified with the key
      scope "map-b". The "map-b" keyscope may be local to the root map that also
      includes map A or may be a peer map referenced with the assoicated
      keyscope "map-b". The key references are the same in both cases.</p>
